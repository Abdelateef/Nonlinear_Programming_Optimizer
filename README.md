# Nonlinear_Programming_Optimizer
The project delves into Non-linear Optimization Algorithms, analyzing their performance on benchmark mathematical problems such as Rosenbrock’s Parabolic and Powell’s Quartic. It implements 1D Minimization Algorithms including Fibonacci, golden section, quadratic interpolation, and cubic interpolation, alongside the Fletcher-Reeves Conjugate Gradient Method. The efficiency of these methods is compared in terms of CPU time and number of iterations.
