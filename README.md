# Nonlinear_Programming_Optimizer
This project delves into Non-linear Optimization Algorithms, analyzing their performance on mathematical problems such as Rosenbrock’s Parabolic and Powell’s Quartic Problems. It implements 1D Minimization Algorithms and the Fletcher-Reeves Conjugate Gradient Method, comparing their efficiency in terms of CPU time and number of iterations.
